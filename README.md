# JMIM Feature Selection (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements the Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) algorithm for feature selection.

JMIM is a filter-based feature selection method that uses information theory concepts such as entropy and mutual information to select relevant and non-redundant features.
