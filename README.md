# JMIM_FEATURE_SELECTION_PYTHON
This project implements the Joint Mutual Information Maximisation (JMIM) algorithm as proposed by Bennasar, Hicks, and Setchi (2015). The algorithm is a filter-based feature selection method that uses information theory to select features that are highly relevant to the class label while being non-redundant with respect to already selected features
